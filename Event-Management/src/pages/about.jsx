        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          It all started with a simple passion for bringing students together
          and creating meaningful connections. Founded in 2020, Campus Connect
          grew from a small initiative into a vibrant platform where events
          aren‚Äôt just activities ‚Äî they‚Äôre opportunities to learn, celebrate,
          and build lasting friendships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we‚Äôve perfected the balance between tradition and
          innovation. Every gathering is carefully planned with creativity,
          collaboration, and purpose, ensuring that each event leaves a positive
          impact on our campus community.
